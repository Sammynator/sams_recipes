    <p><h3>You never drank this milkshake. Or did you? Use this recipe very cautiously. The Memorable Milkshake will erase any memory of ever tasting it and replace it with the feeling of <em>being about to taste it</em>. 'Why is it empty? I just made one? Oh well, guess I'll make another.' And so the cycle continues...</h3></p>

   <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

   <ul>
    <li>¾ teaspoon essence of forgetfulness </li>
    <li>2 <em>different</em> memory playing cards </li>
    <li>1 questioning blueberry</li>
    <li>3 cups of salt (don't worry about how much this is) </li>
    <li>2 whole Snickers Bars</li>
    <li>1 uhmm what happened berry</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons of plain water (<strong>very</strong> important)</li>
   </ul>

   <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>

   <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
   Lay out all the ingredients in front of you on a table of your choice (be careful not to spill the water of course). Now rearrange them, so that the last item is now the first. This step is very important.
   <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
Grab a glass and fill it with milk. It is essential that you only now learn about milk being an ingredient. If you don't have it at hand, go out to buy some now. After filling the glass, drop 1 Snickers Bar in and eat the other. At this point the questioning blueberry will not stop asking you why you're doing this. DO NOT engage. Pour the 3 cups of salt into the glass. 
   <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
  Play with the memory cards. Don't ask how you're supposed to play with only two cards that don't even match. Just do it and trust the process. You can't go wrong here. 
   <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
   Fill in the remaining ingredients. Don't waste a drop of the water, else this will not work. Place the questioning blueberry on top of the cool whip. Oh, yes you need to buy that too. It is important that you only learn about this after having already gone to the store twice.
   <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
   Enjoy! And then enjoy again! And again!
