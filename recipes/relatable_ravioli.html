    <p><h1>The Relatable Ravioli</h1></p>

    <p><h3>Upon eating the relatable ravioli, you will be able to relate to the person who made it. Be very sure that you know who made it and NEVER eat the ravioli if you made them yourself!! </h3></p>

   <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

   <ul>
    <li>2 cups of empathetic flour </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of content-with-life milk</li>
    <li>150g of cheese (your choice)</li>
    <li>3 mindful eggs </li>
    <li>4 ½ basil leafs touched by a person living in Portugal </li>
   </ul>

   <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>

   <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
   Hold small talk with the person who will eat the ravioli. It must be one person at a time. Talking with multiple people at once will confuse the ravioli.
   <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
Pour the empathetic flour in with the content-with-life milk while still keeping the conversation going. Ask a yes/no question while mindfully cracking open the mindful eggs and wait for the answer. The answer must have been 'yes' for you to be able to put the eggs into the bowl. If it is not, keep asking yes/no questions until it is. Then mix in the eggs.
   <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
  Stir the batter with a wooden spoon. The spoon must not have been used on previous Relatable Ravioli batter. 
   <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
  Form the dough into ravioli. Then cook the ravioli. These should be obvious steps.
   <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
   Serve onto a white plate – it is imperial that this plate has not been used to serve relatable ravioli before. Add the basil leafs.
